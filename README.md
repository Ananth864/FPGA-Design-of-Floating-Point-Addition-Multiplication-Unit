# FPGA-Design-of-Floating-Point-Addition-Multiplication-Unit
This project aims to implement floating point multiplication operations using verilog. It takes in a 32 bit string and outputs a 32/64 bit string result. Synthesizable code and testbench are included in this repository along with its simulation. The verilog code can be simulated and implemented on Z-board using vivado.
