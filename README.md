# FPGA-Design-of-Floating-Point-Addition-Multiplication-Unit
This project aims to implement floating point operations such as multiplication and addition using verilog. It takes in two 32/64 bit strings, the operation and the mode
(double or single), performs operations on the inputs and outputs a 32/64 bit string. Synthesizable code and testbench is included in this repository along with its simulation.
