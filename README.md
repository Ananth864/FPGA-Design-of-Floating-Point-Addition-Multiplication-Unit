# FPGA-Design-of-Floating-Point-Addition-Multiplication-Unit
This project aims to implement floating point operations such as multiplication and addition using verilog. It takes in two 32 bit strings, the operation and the mode
(double or single), performs operations on the inputs and outputs a 32/64 bit string. Code and testbench is included in this repository along with its simulation.
